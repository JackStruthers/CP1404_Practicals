# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Movies to Watch 2.0 by Jack Struthers

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of *Movies to Watch*.


# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
This project took me about 12 hours to complete

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
Actually getting the kivy to work well and as i wanted it to

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The fact i forgot to use git when refactoring my first assignment with classes

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Taking this one step at a time. In the beginning I looked at the project as a whole and just didn't know where to start.
After taking a step back and handling it one function at a time rather than how will make all these functions work 
together it really took the edge off.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Just do the project one step at a time rather than trying to do more than one thing at a time

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I primarily used my old practical work to build my classes and the class powerpoint to remember how to use the 
attrgetter. The classes where not to hard over all. The kivy was a bit of headache to begin with but the demos had 
everything you need for this assigment. The spinner for some reason i was most stuck on but the demo got me through it.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The biggest challenge for me was the motivation to do something I had done before but slightly different. I don't 
usually like doing the same thing twice but once i got to the kivy it was fun as it was something new for me to do.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
I loved it, they really clean the code up and make it much easier to follow what is actually happening. It is much
easier than using a list because instead of remembering what number something is you just type what it is. for example
instead of typing movie[0] for the title i can use movie.title. It is so much easier to read and follow overall.
